## How to Use
First, make sure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or higher installed.
1. Download and extract the .zip of this project.
2. Open a terminal (cmd, powershell, git bash, etc.) and `cd` two folders deep into the extracted zip folder (you should be in `jackboxmodpack-main\jackboxmodpack-main`)
3. Run the following commands in order:
- `npm install`
  - this installs packages, dependencies, and other cool shit
- `npm run build`
  - this builds a condensed version of the app
- `npx electron-packager . jackboxmodpack --platform=win32 --arch=x64`
  - this bigass command builds an `.exe` that you can double click to run. I know, I really thought of everything huh.
  - **Note**: this command may take a couple minutes to finish as it's building a giant Windows compatible program for your convenience and we all know how lovely Windows is. If you think it's stuck it's not. Let it cook.
4.  Open two fresh command prompts or powershells.
  - `cd` into `jackboxmodpack-main\jackboxmodpack-main` on the first terminal.
  - Run `serve -s build`.
  - `cd` into `jackboxmodpack-main\jackboxmodpack-main\server` on the second terminal.
  - Run `python app.py`.
    - Running both of these servers is meant to be automatic when you run the .exe but imma automate that shit later bc I need sleep and nourishment and like other human shit rn fr.
5. Click into `jackboxmodpack-win32-x64` and double click that `.exe` biotch!!
> **IMPORTANT**: You will need to run step 4 & 5 every time you want to use this software. Step 4 will be eliminated in the future.

This software is untested af ðŸ”¥
